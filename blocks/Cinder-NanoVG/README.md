# Cinder-NanoVG

This is a C++11 wrapper for Mikko Mononen’s awesome GL-backed vector graphics renderer [**NanoVG**](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg). Additionally, it provides overloads for some of Cinder’s datatypes, and functions for rendering Path2d, Shape2d, PolyLine, SVG, etc. Currently this library must be used with the soon to be released [Cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder) 0.9.0 or greater.

This project is not complete by any means. Features are being added as they are needed. Contributions are definitely welcome!
